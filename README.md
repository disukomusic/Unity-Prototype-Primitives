# Prototype Primitives
I should rename this to "Protyping primitives" but who has the time.

This packages adds new meshes that can be added through the normal menu: GameObject > 3D Object > ...

## Install
1. Open the package manager (Window > Package Manager)
2. Click the plus button in the top left of the package manager, and choose "Add Project from git URL..."
3. Enter the git url of this repository: ```https://github.com/hunterdyar/Unity-Prototype-Primitives.git```

*You may need git installed on your system for this method to work.*

## Meshes
- Cone
- Torus
- Monkey (Suzanne)
